# Analise-grafica-estupro-assedio-e-lesao-corporal-2021

Dashboard with graphics containing information about rape, sexual harassment and bodily injury commited in Brasil in the first semester of 2021.

The database can be found in the [Brazilian Government Official Site](https://www.gov.br/mdh/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/dados-abertos/ligue180/copy_of_primeiro-semestre-de-2021).

It's import can be done by downloading the database with a Google Drive account or using the `!wget <link>` command.

**Resume**

In this project, I created a dashboard using Python, Pandas and Plotly. The reading of the CSV file (provided by Women Call Center - Brazilian Government) was done using Pandas. For the dashboard, I used Dash and Plotly (data visualization). Although Pandas and NumPy were used, their use was limited for educational purpose (using Python language and it's standard data structures for data manipulation)

This was my first data science project, hope you like it!
